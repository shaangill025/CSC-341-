# Software-Development-Project
Software Design Course

This was my Software Engineering's class project. We had a group of four working on this during the semester. I was in charge of the GUI of this project. The goal of this project was to create a program to help the (imaginary) business called Chocoholics Annonymous. We had to create a database and program so that they could use it in thier offices. The only way to actually start the program was to be a part of the database's system. We used the Microsoft Azure Portal and had to input our IP's into the firewall to pass the system.
<p>GUI was implemented using JavaFX. To understand the design further and its implementation JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0 is required. Open up the files labeled as .fxml in the folder (MainSEProject\MainSEProject\src\Graphics\gui). The rest of the folder of Graphics are the controllers, which are connected to the .fxml files. These allowed me to use and attach events using java.
<p>Apart from helping my team member with JavaFX, I mainly focused on JAVA backend implementation, SQL commands and quries, setting up of SQL server using MS Azure serivce follwed by hosting the database on it as well as using Quartz API for report generation. The connection between JAVA and SQL server [&database] was established using sqljdbc_4.0.
